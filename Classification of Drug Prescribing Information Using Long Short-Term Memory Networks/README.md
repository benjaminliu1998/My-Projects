### Abstract

Information about drug’s safety and efficacy is publicly available to healthcare providers and consumers in the United States. Yet, it remains challenging to find this information for special populations of patients. These populations include pregnant, lactating, nursing women, elderly, and pediatric populations. Motivated by the unmet need for the accurate and efficient extraction of information, we trained a multi-class Long Short-Term Memory classifier with over 90,000 semi-structured labeled texts. The classifier achieved excellent performance when tested on an unseen dataset of 20,000 texts, reaching between 95% to 99% accuracy for the five classes. The LSTM model significantly outperformed the baseline Naïve Bayes classifier, especially in classifying texts containing information relevant to nursing mothers.
